# Practical Calculator for Introductory Statistics

A lightweight, web-based calculator designed to simplify complex statistical calculations, specifically tailored for introductory statistics courses. It eliminates the hassle of manual input and reduces dependency on traditional scientific calculators for routine tasks like factorials, permutations, and combinations.

## Features

- **Factorial Calculation:** Compute factorials of numbers directly (e.g., entering `5!` returns `120`).
- **Permutations and Combinations:** Simplified computation for:
  - \( nPr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \)
  - \( nCr = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \)
- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive design that prioritizes ease of use.
- **Responsive Design:** Compatible with desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Motivation

Performing statistical calculations using traditional scientific calculators can be time-consuming and prone to errors. This project bridges that gap by providing a straightforward, accessible tool for students and educators.
